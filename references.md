# Literature on Grant Writing

The following references provide you with basic common knowledge on grant writing. While they don't replace a book, a course, let alone speaking to an experienced scientist about your application, they at least give you a starting point:

* [The Art of Grantsmanship by Jacob Kraicer](http://www.hfsp.org/funding/art-grantsmanship)
