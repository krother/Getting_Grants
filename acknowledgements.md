The material in this ebook has been inspired by the Scientific Communication courses given by Edward Potworowski. Editing grant applications under the auspices of Janusz M. Bujnicki helped me a lot, and Alfred Pingoud added several points I would have missed otherwise. I also would like to thank Agnieszka Ludwików, Lorna Lück, Eva-Maria Aulich and Anja Drescher for the opportunity to field-test early versions of the texts found in this book.
