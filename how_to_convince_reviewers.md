# How to convince the reviewers?

Reviewers are scientists working after hours. They usually do not get paid for their work. To convince a reviewer, you need to show that you appreciate his efforts and don't waste his time. Most reviewers are from a related field, so you can assume they speak the same language but do not know most of the components you are working on. Generally, reviewers can be convinced by making their work easier. Reviewers typically have to comment on a number of criteria. Show them the value of your work by providing clear answers for each criterion in your application. Commonly, these criteria include:

#### Feasible 

The methods are known, you have the equipment, preliminary data, papers

#### Adequate

The right call and the right time

#### Original

A new combination of skills, a problem you solve, a unique context

#### Risks covered

Preliminary data, risk analysis or contingency plan, plan B

#### Productivity

Your CV, complementary collaborators, papers

#### Competent

Match of researcher and project (why are you the best person to do it)

For each category you can write an explicit answer in one sentence. Make it bold if you like. You can provide the details afterwards for those interested. Then the reviewer will not have to search in your application for long.
